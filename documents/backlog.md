Backlog
=======

-   Remove pathstore populate, which can now be done by walk second.

-   Unit tests run from Blender.

-   Get a JSON representation of a path store principal.

-   HTTP server that responds to a GET request with a JSON representation of the
    path store.

-   Blender upgrade and check Python version.

-   Move heavier diagnostic logs into unit tests in which Mock objects track
    calls.

-   Maybe change some implementations to inherit from UserDict or UserList.
