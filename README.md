Blender Driver
==============
The Blender Driver project was originally about running a Python HTTP server
from within a Blender Game Engine (BGE) instance. The server could receive input
from a web browser, REST client, or other similar software. It would then use
the BGE Python interface to feed commands into a three-dimensional scene.

Getting Started
===============
You will need Blender, which is available from https://blender.org
